Stimfit will now require Biosig, for the following reasons: 

Biosig 2.3.1 and later provides the following advantages: 
Biosig's ATF: 
	support for more than 2 channels 
	much faster loading 
Biosig's HEKA Import 
	correct scaling and channel order (when scaling, channel order or sampling rate changes)
Biosig's ABF2:
	correct scaling of y-axis 
Biosig's AXG:
	now supported by biosig, too. 

Therefore, building Stimfit will now require Biosig. It is recommended to use libbiosig 2.3.1 or later.
(Using earlier versions will still provide a fall-back for ATF, ABF2 and AXG to the internal import functions.)



fileformat support 
	ABF	import with stimfit and biosig
>	ABF2	import stimfit, partial import biosig
	ATF	import/export in Stimfit, 
>	AGX	some files are supported by Stimfit, which are not supported by biosig 
	CFS	import with both, export only stimfit
<	HEKA	import with biosig only
	HDF5	import/export stimfit
?	INTAN	import with both
	IGOR	import/export withs stimfit
